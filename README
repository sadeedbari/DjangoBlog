To run demo:
From windows command line: 
cd into the local directory where the project is saved 
type: "python manage.py runserver"
In your browser, navigate to: http://localhost:8000/blog

Note that forget password will not work in this testing environment. 
In order to make it work when running the program locally, you need to add System Environment Variables
Steps: 
1) In system settings (control pannel) navigate to System Properties 
2) Nav to Edit the System Environment Variables
3) Click Environment Variables button on the bottom
4) Under user variables, you need to add 2 variables: 
	Variable-1 name = [EMAIL_USER]; value = [ENTER YOUR GMAIL EMAIL ADDRESS]
	Variable-2 name = [EMAIL_PASS]; value = [ENTER YOUR GMAIL EMAIL PASSWORD]
*Since you are creating these variables on your local machine, it is safe to enter the information here
*If Email flow does not work, you need to to you your GMAIL settings and toggle on "Less secure app access" from Gmail security settings
